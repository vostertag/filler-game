# Filler Game

This project was the first one I have ever made using Java. 

In the filler game, there is up to 4 players. At the beginning of the match, each one starts at one of the corner of the map. The goal is to own the biggest part of the map to win.

In order to get bigger, the player must choose one of the colors by clicking on one of the squares. He cannot, however, choose his current color or the one of his opponent.

Once one of the players owns most of the map, the game ends.

You can add a fog of war:

As well as obstacles (in grey):

Finally, it is possible to create your own map using the ![Grid Editor](https://github.com/vostertag/filler-edit).
